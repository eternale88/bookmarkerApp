# bookmarkerApp

## Synopsis

My bookmarking App that allows a user to save and delete their favorite websites. For persistance I used HTML5 localStorage API, CSS and BootStrap 4, and some ES6 Vanilla JavaScript. Planning to add Babel as an ES5 JavaScript compiler next.

## Motivation

To learn more about and grow my skills in frontend development and working with HTML5 API's and ES6 JavaScript . 

## Installation
